# Spacexplorer ðŸš€

This application is built with React, Express, Graphql, Mysql.

Allow you to browse and book space trips from [SpaceX APIs](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/).

Live [here](https://spacexplorer.now.sh/).

## Motivation

* I want to build a web application to experiment with GraphQL.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && yarn i && yarn start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && yarn i && yarn start
```
